## Analyzing college majors and their employment prospects

**Abstract**  
In this analysis, I've collected data from U.S. Census Bureau regarding college majors and have analyzed them to peek into various trends in the college major adoption in terms of employment prospects, income, type of employment (stability), gender patterns. Instead of being a mere analysis, this takes into consideration human-centred factors. Three research questions have been chosen and have been answered in through this analysis. It is found that Arts majors have a high gap between general employment rate and full-time year-round employment rate. Also, for interdisciplinary majors the employment rate for grads is found to be much higher than for non-grads. In addition, it is seen that there is no primary overlap between the median incomes for majors that have >90% men and those that have >90% women.
